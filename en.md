# Projek Electronic Cane - <ins>EN</ins> / [BM](https://github.com/TERMZL0ckd0wn/Tongkat-Elektronik/blob/main/README.md)
This project is a cane for old people to detect obstacles that is not in thier view. This project uses some licenses, these licenses can be found [here](#licenses).

## Full Explaination

This cane is typically used by people of old age or the same circumstance as them for detecting obstacles that is out of their field of view. This cane also has another feature. It is not just detecting objects, it can also detect the presence of water because of the water sensor on the bottom of the cane for detecting puddles and such. This cane uses electric and electronic components that is easy to acquire in the current market.

**List of electric components :**
1. Switch
2. Wire
3. Battery
4. Battery Holder

**List of electronic components :**
1. Arduino Nano (Can also be used for the Arduino UNO)
2. Ultrasonic Sensor
3. Water Sensor
4. Buzzer

Other than that, The chassis that holds the components together can be 3D Printed. The chassis design is simple, compact and quite lightwheight. If you want to make other designs of the case, that can be easily achived by using a web-app called [TinkerCAD](https://tinkercad.com).

## Project files

**The code** can be downloaded at the top of this page by pressing `Code`>`Download ZIP` and unzip the file. Then, open the `.ino` using the Arduino IDE or any text editor (such as Notepad). PS: For Malay, open `TongkatElektronik` folder for code. But for English, open `ElectronicCane`.

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to print this model. You have to slice it using a slicer (e.g. `Ultimaker Cura`).
